DAYS

Backend:
- update Day to have description (String) and not date (date inputs are hard - leave that for description for now?)

Frontend:
- API bindings for get/set/add day
- add lark for adding/editing a day. modal for add, inline on entries list for edit (so we can drag entries from list into description?)
- add markdown parser (may as well use throughout). use on event/day descriptions
- day descriptions will split on '@entry:ABcQw' .. and render entries in their place, updating the day description and day entry list at same time on backend
- can we drag and drop entries into the day description?
- until entries part of description, show in list below instead. may be easier going straight to showing in list tho.

ELEVATE MODE

Frontend:
- add "ADMIN MODE ON/OFF" button for admin users.
- add isAdminMode prop in model for button to toggle.
- make things check this rather than whether user is admin to show various adminy things.
