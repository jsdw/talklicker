# talklicker

A small Haskell+Elm event scheduling app.

A SPA Made to organise events and days at work - one can login, add events to a list that they would like to 
(mainly talks that they would like to give), and then an admin can create a Day, describe it in Markdown
and drag events into slots throughout the description.
